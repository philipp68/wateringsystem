# Balcony irrigation system

Welcome to this simple project where I'm using a Photon IOT device to create an automated irrigation system.

## Setting up the development environment

### Setting up our Photon
1. Go to particle.io
2. Set up an account
3. Connect your phonton to the particle cloud
4. Check that your photon is up and running and connected to the cloud on https://console.particle.io/devices
5. Go to the WebIDE to start writing code for the Photon https://build.particle.io/build

### Setting up your Mac
1. To enable simple debugging using loggin statements, you need to set up your terminal.
2. Connect the Photon to your Mac with a USB cable.
2. ls /dev/tty.* to find the name of your USB modem 
3. screen /dev/tty.usbmodem1411 9600
